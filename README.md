# Project 2 - Location Sharing Webapp

## Project Description

The Location Sharing Webapp allows users to easily store and share locations with one another. Registered users can search any address through a built-in google maps API, and save the location with a custom title. They can then generate a link and associated QR code that can be used to display this address. Any user, whether or not they are logged in, can use one of these links to retrieve an address and see the location displayed on google maps.
